## Abstract
"In The Other Half of Church, pastor Michel Hendricks and neurotheologian Jim Hendricks couple brain science and the Bible to identify how to overcome spiritual stagnation by living a full-brained faith. They also identify the four ingredients necessary to develop and maintain a vibrant transformational community where spiritual formation occurs, relationships flourish, and the toxic spread of narcissism is eradicated"--

> Jim explained that all of the ways in which we interpret our world, from seeing an expression on a friend’s face to smelling our grandmother’s roast chicken cooking in the oven, enter into our dual processor brain on the back of the right side. Processing the smell of the chicken shifts from the back to the front of the right side, and somewhere behind our right eye it crosses over to the left side. Then the smell of grandma’s chicken processes from the front to the back on the left side. It is like going up one supermarket aisle and then crossing over and returning on the next aisle to the left. Everything takes this path. Words in a conversation. A handshake. A favorite song. A puzzled look on a friend’s face. A math problem. The taste of grandma’s chicken when you finally sit down and eat. That and everything else you experience follows this path. Back to front on the right side, front to back on the left side.

> Jim explained it this way: “The right hemisphere process that creates our working identity integrates our reality six times per second. The brain brings together current experience and emotionally important personal memories to create an active sense of who we are in our relationships at that moment. This happens faster than we can become conscious, so we assume we just ‘know’ who we are at all times.”

> Jim explained that our instantaneous reactions to our surroundings are created before our conscious mind is aware of them. He called them our “gut reactions and first options for response.” These reactions are faster than conscious thought. Our immediate response is what we call character—how we spontaneously react to our surroundings.

> Many Western Christians believe character is formed by thinking correctly, believing truth, and making wise choices in light of the truth.5 If all of this is empowered by the Holy Spirit, we are on the path to Christian maturity. This is the philosophy I used to help people grow in their faith. I remember leading a training by saying, “To change our character, we need to change our thinking. New thinking produces new behavior.” Most Christian communities agree, and it is true that correct thinking is important in discipleship. The problem is that this anthropology ignores other, more dominant drivers of character change.

> The right brain integrates our life, including our connection to loved ones, our bodies, our surroundings, our emotions, our identities, and our community. Character formation flows out of these connections. The right brain processes these questions: Who is happy to see me here? What do I feel right now? Is there anyone here who understands me? How do I act like myself right now? What do my people do in this situation? The answers to these questions drive our character development.

> Dallas Willard’s mission was to put discipleship back at the center of church where it belongs. He believed that leaders must become “possessed” by the importance of discipleship. There are many good things pastors can do, but discipleship is the one thing pastors must do. All other activities and programs work best when they flow from a robust maturity formed through discipleship. When discipleship becomes the “exclusive primary goal of the local congregation,”7 everything a church accomplishes is done in the character of Christ.

They talked about evangelism. I didn’t know that word, either. They used a lot of words I didn’t know. They also sang songs that were strange to my musical ears. I liked the people, though, and quickly got into a small group. Within a few weeks, I was studying the Bible with new friends, and they taught me the basics about being a disciple of Jesus. They taught me how to study the Bible, how to pray and how to share my faith. One thing I wasn’t taught was the importance of joy and relational attachments. I wasn’t taught it, but I was shown it.

> Once the clinic started focusing on building patients’ joy before treating their trauma, hospitalization rates plummeted to almost zero. They were filling up their clients’ gas tanks with joy fuel before beginning the heavy work of trauma recovery. Trying to do emotionally taxing work with an empty tank is like running a marathon without having eaten food for a month. Eventually your body will shut down for lack of energy. Jim’s patients would emotionally collapse. We run the same danger in our churches and families when we do not build our joy together as a part of ministry. We eventually drain our tanks and run on empty.

These two characteristics assure that my right brain stays involved in the practice. Otherwise it can easily shift toward leftbrained gratitude (words) instead of right brained gratitude (images, autobiographical memories, relational connection, body integration). Building joy is a right-brain dominant exercise.

> From the brain’s perspective, trauma happens anytime we suffer alone. Suffering turns into trauma when we are unable to process our suffering with God and other people. Trauma is stored in our brain, in circuits of flesh, kind of like an armed mousetrap. When something goes wrong that feels like a previous trauma to our brain, not only do we experience unpleasant emotions, but our trauma gets triggered. The mousetrap goes SNAP! The trauma magnifies the already big feelings, and we get stuck in distress.

> When our eyes and face are staring at our phones, we are not engaging with the faces around us. The joy drains out of our communities by depriving ourselves of each other’s faces. Our need for face-to-face time is designed into our flesh and cannot be substituted with a screen. Our brains can distinguish between a real face and a face on a screen even when we are infants. Our neurological circuits do not react to screens the same as they do to live faces. Since we need facial joy like we need food and oxygen, we are starving ourselves of relational nutrition. Parents can start by putting limits on screen time and emphasizing face-to-face conversation. You will be surprised how different you and your family will feel when you look at each other in the face. Plugging this joy leak will involve being countercultural. Churches must lead the way by restoring joy to our soil.

> Perhaps the biggest surprise emerging from brainscan studies has been that, for our brain, identity develops through attachments. Joyful, secure attachments build a good brain. Fearful or weak attachments build a bad brain. When we say “a bad brain,” we mean an identity center that damages our relationships when we are upset. Character develops through relationships—hesed relationships4 —that can handle times when things go wrong. A secure hesed attachment can ride through storms and remain loving. Character in the brain is an expression of an identity that has grown strong and well. As Christians, we want an identity in our brain that looks like Jesus.

> A similar dynamic happens in the church. Jesus intends His church to function as a family that is bonded together with joyful attachments of love. Like a baby with her two smiling parents, our churches can create environments for developing our joyful identities as children of God. When we live in a family of joyful hesed relationships, we put our brains into the ideal zone for developing us into the image of Christ. We are filled with joy and surrounded with stable, deep attachments. Our prefrontal cortex is energized to build a stable identity.

Developments in modern brain science have made it clear that any model of transformation and character change must be anchored in the development of a love bond with God and His people.10 (italics mine)

We see the stream of God’s love spreading spiritual nutrition through our hesed attachments, from top to bottom. Our character is transformed through this flow of love.

> Low-hesed churches may look fine on the outside. People may be friendly and enthusiastic about their church. They might be excited about their five-year plans and bold strategies to grow and do great things. Prioritizing plans and vision above hesed attachments (the prime movers of growth) produces little transformation. Many churches do good things in their communities and around the world, but operate more like an efficiently run religious institution than a family. They do many good things but may not possess good character.

I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false. You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary. (vv. 2–3) This sounds pretty good so far. The Ephesian church is hardworking, and they don’t give up. They have good doctrine and aren’t corrupted by evil people who spread false teaching. They suffer for Jesus in a hostile city. If this were my church, I

Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place. (vv. 4–5) Ouch! It looked like they were doing everything well, but Jesus delivers a blunt rebuke. They stopped acting like a family and started functioning like an institution. We hear Jesus’ opinion of a church that does many good things but does not function as a hesed-connected family. The consequence, if they do not restore their hesed, is that He will come and turn off the lights.

If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket—safe, dark, motionless, airless —it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable.12

What is our attitude toward inconvenient interruptions of our plans? How do I react to abandonment? What do I do when people praise me and want to promote me? How do I love people?

Many of us have a habit of bonding with the food itself instead of the One who provided the food or the person who prepared it. Bonding with food leads to food addictions and unhealthy eating habits. When we bond with the food, we do not build our attachment with others at the table and God who provided the meal. For food to act as a bonding agent, we need good teaching and training in the community. Learning how to use food and drink to build our love for each other should be part of every church’s discipleship program.

Many years later, he wrote to Christians, “But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession” (1 Peter 2:9). Chosen, royal, holy, special. These strong words describe a new people inhabiting God’s kingdom. Jesus Himself lived out of a strong identity, and He taught it to His disciples. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus delivers a heavy dose of group identity for a chosen, royal, holy, special people. He answers the questions: What kind of people are we? How do we act as members of God’s kingdom on earth?

For the brain, these activities converge in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). “The right prefrontal cortex is dominant for combining our values into our known responses. In particular, the ventromedial section of the PFC will seek the least damaging response to any situation. Character is the combination of our known responses (what people have done in the past) and our values (what our people prefer to do). We must eliminate the many responses that our people would not value.”

> Healthy shame is a nonverbal spontaneous reaction to a face that is not happy to be with me. Healthy shame is the opposite of joy. We detect shame primarily from facial cues and voice tone. My right brain can tell from your face that I have lowered your joy. We can learn to be relational in shame, so healthy shame does not leave me alone. A healthy shame message is of the form, “I love you but believe that you stopped acting like yourself. Let me remind you how we act in this situation.” Our hesed helps us regulate the emotional energy of shame. Without hesed, shame will push us to isolate and hide, which naturally sinks us into unhealthy shame. Most of us never learned to experience shame and stay relationally connected.

Toxic shame (toxic shame gets most of the attention in the public mind) happens when we are told that there is a problem (“we don’t like your character right now”) but no relational solution is provided. Without a relational solution, people will eventually try to silence the pain with something. The common ways to pull the battery out of our emotional alarm are what we call addictions.

(See Resources at the end of the chapter).5 This is quickly becoming a lost skill in many churches, and people like James are needed to train the next generation. In chapter 4, we discovered that sharing weakness increases hesed, one of the four ingredients of healthy soil. By sharing our stories of being corrected, we are adding two ingredients to our relational soil at once. When I share my character flaws, I am sharing a weakness, which increases our hesed. At the same time, I am giving you an example of eagerly accepting correction. Two essential nutrients at the same time! Our relational soil is rapidly improving.

In God’s kingdom, shame is always combined with a strong dose of love.

What is happening in the hearts of these leaders and in the hearts of the people who surround them? 3 We must address the relational soil that nourishes and encourages narcissistic behavior, otherwise the church will often select a narcissistic pastor to fill the position of the recently fired narcissist. Or another narcissistic leader will emerge from the staff of the church and finally get the leadership position they felt they always deserved. The infection returns.

> The pulpit is a strong magnet for narcissists, and they use it to achieve what they crave: attention, control, being at the center, being able to create the narrative. For the narcissist pastor, the sermon becomes performance art. . Up on a stage, the grand leader can appear to have a strong connection with the congregation while maintaining real relational distance. The stage, the image magnification, and the microphone allow pastors to appear close while avoiding real attachments to anyone who might threaten their control and sense of being special. From this exalted position they can choose their friends carefully. Surrounded by a supportive community of weakly attached people with a shallow group identity, pastors can exercise significant control.

Self-justification can be deceiving. We choose narcissists for our leaders precisely because they are so good at justifying themselves. They are good at having all the answers and sounding right. People who have not been trained to spot self-justification misjudge it for self-confidence. To the discerning, the justifications sound reasonable at first, but they know something is wrong below the surface. A stiff neck is often well hidden.

A church planted in rich relational soil may be less visually stimulating than other churches, but it is relationally stimulating.

We hang large screens above the stage to magnify their face as the Teacher. Their enormous image looms above us as we listen to them dispense wisdom. Do families act like this? The use of video magnification in a church may be necessary, but pastors should simultaneously be modeling “image shrinkification” more often.

Our character is formed by stories, so a Great Commission church is a storytelling church. However, not all stories touch our character.

This is the only place in Scripture describing a typical church gathering. “When you come together, each of you has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up.” The phrase “each of you” should be ringing in your ears. When Paul refers to “each of you,” he is not just referring to leaders or staff. He addresses this letter “to the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be his holy people, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Cor. 1:2).

It doesn’t matter, as long as you feel gratitude when you think about it. • Give it a twoto three-word title (for example, “Dan and Dave,” “Shining Goldfinch,” “Balloon Soccer”) • In a quiet place, go back into this memory and relive it for a minute, like you are back in it • Ask: What did you feel in your body? Maybe “peace” or “lightness” (it doesn’t matter what you feel as long as you feel something in your body) What might God be communicating to you through the memory and the peace you feel? God is with me and likes to share His beauty with me.

> Phase : Gratitude for Five inutes 1. Start compiling a list of grateful memories as described above. Each memory has two characteristics: 1) you feel gratitude in your body, and 2) you feel a connection with God in the memory. Eventually, you want a list of at least ten grateful memories. 2. Once a day, spend five minutes residing in gratitude using your list of grateful memories. It is mostly nonverbal. You are feeling a connection with God in your body as you relive memories of gratitude. Note: Spending five minutes reliving memories without being distracted is difficult if you have never done it before. It will take you a while to be able to sustain the full five minutes without daydreaming or going off on tangents. Give yourself grace. You may be exercising a muscle in your heart that hasn’t been used much. Use your list of memories during the five minutes. Some days a single memory will sustain you for five minutes. More commonly, you will need three to five memories to fill five minutes. When the gratitude of one memory starts to fade, go to another one on the list.

> A better model of the brain suggests that the part of the brain that is in control (dominant) is relatively quiet when all is well. The faster-than-conscious thought track in the right prefrontal area is dominant for our identity, character, values, and relationships. When all is well in our identity and relationships our right prefrontal areas sits quietly by and lets the slower system, left prefrontal, handle conscious interactions with the world. We are in a happy mood, for all is well with the now quiet relational right brain. When something goes wrong with our identity and significant relationships, the right brain fires up to deal with this distressing problem. The left brain goes into a sort of “standby” level, and we are in distress. The solution is not to shut down the relational repair system so we feel fine. The solution is to find a relational solution to what has taken away our joy. Then the master system will go back to watching the left brain play happily in its conscious speed world.

> It would be a second and major mistake to assume that because the control is located one place in the brain that there is where all the work is being done. What has been called “left brain” or “right brain” is generally done all over the brain even when some part of the brain is dominant for the unification of effort.
