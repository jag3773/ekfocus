I just added all of the vocabulary for Biblical Hebrew that occurs in [_Basics of Biblical Hebrew_](https://www.amazon.com/Basics-Biblical-Hebrew-Grammar-Second/dp/0310520673/), by Gary Pratico and Miles Van Pelt, into [Quisition](https://quisition.com/library/?search=Basics+of+Biblical+Hebrew&sort=). I've also added a special pack called [Misc. to 70x](https://quisition.com/library/pack/1204/basics-of-biblical-hebrew-misc-to-70x/), which has all of the words down to 70x frequency that do not appear in _Basics of Biblical Hebrew_. After learning all of the vocab packs plus this special one then the student will be able to start memorizing more [vocabulary starting at 69x frequency](https://quisition.com/topics/topic/hebrew/).

Happy Learning!
