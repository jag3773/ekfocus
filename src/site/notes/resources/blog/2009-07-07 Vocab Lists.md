This page contains lists of Hebrew vocabulary arranged by frequency. Each file is a pipe (|) delimited text file containing the Hebrew word on the left side and the English gloss(es) and frequency count on the right side.

The files are exports from the vocabulary packs available on [http://www.quisition.com](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.quisition.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3d8kxCN6fv7PzP0i8vy973). The source of these is Van Pelt, M. and G. Pratico, [_The Vocabulary Guide to Biblical Hebrew_](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FVocabulary-Guide-Biblical-Hebrew%2Fdp%2F0310250722&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2ZeOCMJsMhXy-LPGqvBMx4)_,_ Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2003. The book is well worth the money as it contains many more valuable resources.
