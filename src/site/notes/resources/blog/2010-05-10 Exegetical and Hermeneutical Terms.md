If anyone is looking to memorize common exegetical terms and/or common hermeneutical fallacies, I've added many of them into www.quisition.com.  They are taken from the appendices of the book [_Old Testament Exegesis_](https://www.amazon.com/Old-Testament-Exegesis-Handbook-Students/dp/0664233449), by Douglas Stuart.

You can view them by [clicking here](https://quisition.com/library/pack/1142/ote-exegetical-terms/).
