_Edit: the site linked to below is no longer available_

There is a neat site called [Greek and Hebrew Paradigms Quiz](http://quiz.emergence.dk/) which is designed to test users on their parsing ability.  I highly encourage you to give it a try and see if it is helpful for you.  It looks to me a like a great way to quiz yourself on verbal forms.
