“Community, given human nature and human interests, is very, very hard to realize. It comes more readily to a family, a congregation, and a company of people who have shared profound experience than it does to the college and university, to say nothing of the nation. Community occurs among people who can share each other’s secrets and exact profound commitment…To belong to a college does not mean the surrender of one’s belongings and loyalties…rather a campus is a set of people who form associations where less is at risk than in true community.”
