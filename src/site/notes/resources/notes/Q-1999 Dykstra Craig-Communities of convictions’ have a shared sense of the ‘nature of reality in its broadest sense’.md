"’Communities of convictions’ have a shared sense of the ‘nature of reality in its broadest sense’…’colleges and universities form students morally most thoroughly and most powerfully through the fundamental patterns of inquiry, learning, and teaching that they practice. To the extent that they succeed in guiding students into attention to what is real, they succeed in the formation of both character and vision."
