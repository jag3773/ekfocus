In three short verses in [[resources/bible/gospels/Acts 14#14:21\|Acts 14#14:21]] [[resources/bible/gospels/Acts 14#14:22\|Acts 14#14:22]] [[resources/bible/gospels/Acts 14#14:23\|Acts 14#14:23]], we see a summary of the mission that Barnabas and Paul carried out. The mission began in [[resources/bible/gospels/Acts 13\|Acts 13]] and is just now coming to a conclusion. Luke provides a didactic summary statement, serving not only as a summary but a concise definition of missionary activity:

- When they had **preached the gospel** to that city and
- had **made many disciples**,
  - they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,
- **strengthening the souls** of the disciples,
- encouraging them to **continue in the faith**, and
  - saying that through **many tribulations** we must enter the **kingdom of God**.
- And when they had **appointed elders** for them in every church,
- with prayer and fasting they **committed them to the Lord** in whom they had believed.
