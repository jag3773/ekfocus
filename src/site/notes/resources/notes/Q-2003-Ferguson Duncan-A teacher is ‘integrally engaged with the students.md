"A teacher is ‘integrally engaged with the students…done in community’. The Reformed tradition has affirmed that faith is nurtured in community, that theological beliefs are formed and checked in community…It is in community that we begin to discover our vocation, and create a context for our students to own values and convictions, form their identity, better understand their gifts, and discern their calling in life. It is in community that we begin to grasp who we are, where we are going, and how we might get there.”
