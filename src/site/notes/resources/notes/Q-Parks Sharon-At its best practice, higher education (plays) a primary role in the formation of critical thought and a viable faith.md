“At its best practice, higher education (plays) a primary role in the formation of critical thought and a viable faith. For the young adult, community finds its most powerful form in a mentoring community…It offers a network of belonging to which young adults feel recognized as who they really are, and as who they are becoming. It offers both challenge and support and thus offers good company for both the emerging strength and the distinctive vulnerability of the young adult.”
