I put together an over of DMM/CPM models or pathways as described in various books. This is not a synthesis, just a conglomeration of various diagrams or models presented by the authors. Books referenced here:

- Allen, Roland, and Jawbone Digital. _The Spontaneous Expansion of the Church: And the Causes Which Hinder It_. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2018.
- Christopherson, Jeff, and Mac Lake. _Kingdom First: Starting Churches That Shape Movements_. B&H Books, 2015.
- Gerke, Damian, and Curtis Sergeant. _In the Way: Church As We Know It Can Be a Discipleship Movement_, 2020.
- Hirsch, Alan. _The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church_. Grand Rapids, MI: Us Imports, 2007.
- John, Victor, Stan Parks, and Dave Coles. _Bhojpuri Breakthrough: A Movement That Keeps Multiplying_. WIGTake Resources, 2019.
- Reach, Robert M. _Movements That Move_. ChurchSmart Resources, 2016.

I also prompted ChatGPT to give me an overview of church planting principles that lead to movements being started. You can see the full text of that in [[resources/notes/2023-09-17 ChatGPT on Church Planting Movement Principles\|2023-09-17 ChatGPT on Church Planting Movement Principles]].
