"The ideal community is a ‘bonding community that certainly brings about private good, but also public good for the benefit of all who share in this sense of family & community…a faith based community, a Christ-centered community, grounded in a commitment to a Christian worldview that can and will be able to engage the culture.”

David Dockery in “From Lone Ranger to Christian Scholar/Teacher in Community.
